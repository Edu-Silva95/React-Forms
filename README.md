This project "React Forms" main focus was to explore and learn about Forms and UserInput. 

I then connected everything so that I can easly access both Login and SignUp pages, and created a very basic Home page styled with Tailwind.

The reason for this, was simply to give it a more complete aspect. Instead of just choosing to load between the SignUp, the Login(uses Ref), or StateLogin pages. (Currently loading the Login.jsx).

This project was built with and for the "React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)" - Udemy Course.
